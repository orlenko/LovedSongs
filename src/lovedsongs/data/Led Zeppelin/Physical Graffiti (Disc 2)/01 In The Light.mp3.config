S"In The Light lyrics\nAnd if you feel that you can't go on. And your will's sinkin' low\nJust believe and you can't go wrong.\nIn the light you will find the road. You will find the road\nOh, did you ever believe that I could leave you, standing out in the cold\nI know how it feels 'cause I have slipped through to the very depths of my soul.\nI just wanna show what I'd give you it is from every bend in the road\nNow listen to me\nOh, whoa-whoa, as I was and really would be for you, too, honey\nAs you would for me, oh, I would share your load.\nLet me share your load. Ooh, let me share, share your load\nAnd if you feel that you can't go on\nIn the light you will find the road\nThough the winds of change may blow around you, but that will always be so\nWhen love is pain it can devour you, if you are never alone\nI would share your load. I would share your load\nBaby, let me, oh, let me\nIn the light\nEverybody needs the light.\nIn the light, in the light, in the light\nLight, light, light, in the light\nLight, light, light, in the light, ooh, yeah\nLight, light, light, in the light"
