S"Oh let the sun beat down upon my face\nStars to fill my dreams\nI am a traveler of both time and space\nTo be where I have been\n\nSecret elders of the gentle race\nThis world is seldom seen\nThey talk of days for which they sit and wait\nAll will be revealed\n\nTalk and song from tongues of lilting grace\nWhose sounds caress my ear\nBut not a word I heard could I relate\nThe story was quite clear\nWoah, woah\n\nOoh, oh baby I been flying\nLord yeah mama, there ain't no denyin'\nOh, ooh yes, I've been flying\nMama ma, ain't no denyin', no denyin'\n\nOh all I see turns to brown as the sun burns the ground\nAnd my eyes fill with sand as I scan this wasted land\nTrying to find, trying to find where I been\n\nOh, pilot of the storm who leaves no trace\nLike thoughts inside a dream\nHeed the path that led me to that place\nYellow desert screen\n\nMy Shangri-La beneath the summer moon\nI will return again\nSure as the dust that floats high in June\nWhen movin' through Kashmir\n\nOh, father of the four winds\nFill my sails, across the sea of years\nWith no provision but an open face\n'Long the straits of fear\nWoah, woah, woah\n\nOh\n\nWell, when I want\nWhen I'm on my way, yeah\nWhen I see\nWhen I see the way, you stay, yeah\n\nOoh, yeah yeah, ooh, yeah yeah, well I'm down, yes\nOoh, yeah yeah, ooh, yeah yeah, well I'm down, so down\nOoh, my baby, ooh, my baby, let me take you there\n\nOh oh, come on, come on\nOh, let me take you there\nLet me take you there\nOoh, yeah yeah, ooh, yeah yeah\n"
