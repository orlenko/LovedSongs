S'In My Time Of Dying lyrics\nIn my time of dying, want nobody to mourn\nAll I want for you to do is take my body home\nWell, well, well, so I can die easy\n[X2]\nJesus, gonna make up my dyin\' bed.\nMeet me, Jesus, meet me. Meet me in the middle of the air\nIf my wings should fail me, Lord. Please meet me with another pair\nWell, well, well, so I can die easy\n[X2]\nJesus, gonna make up.. somebody, somebody...\nJesus gonna make up... Jesus gonna make you my dyin\' bed\nOh, Saint Peter, at the gates of heaven... Won\'t you let me in\nI never did no harm. I never did no wrong\nOh, Gabriel, let me blow your horn. Let me blow your horn\nOh, I never did, did no harm.\nI\'ve only been this young once. I never thought I\'d do anybody no wrong\nNo, not once.\nOh, I did somebody some good. Somebody some good...\nOh, did somebody some good. I must have did somebody some good...\nAnd I see them in the streets\nAnd I see them in the field\nAnd I hear them shouting under my feet\nAnd I know it\'s got to be real\nOh, Lord, deliver me\nAll the wrong I\'ve done\nYou can deliver me, Lord\nI only wanted to have some fun.\nHear the angels marchin\', hear the\' marchin\', hear them marchin\',\nhear them marchin\', the\' marchin\'\nOh my Jesus...\n[repeat]\nOh, don\'t you make it my dyin\', dyin\', dyin\'...\n[Studio Chatter:]\n"That\'s gonna be the one, isn\'t it? "\n"Come have a listen, then. "\nOh yes, thank you."'
