S"Trampled Underfoot lyrics\nGreasy slicked down body, groovy leather trim\nI like the way you hold the road, mama, it ain't no sin\nTalkin' 'bout love [X3]\nTrouble-free transmission, helps your oil's flow\nMama, let me pump your gas, mama, let me do it all\nTalkin' 'bout love [X3]\nDig that heavy metal underneath your hood\nBaby, I could work all night, believe I've got the perfect tools\nTalkin' 'bout love [X3]\nA model built for comfort, really built with style\nSpecialist tradition, mama, let me feast my eyes\nTalkin' 'bout love [X3]\nFactory air-conditioned, heat begins to rise\nGuaranteed to run for hours, mama it's a perfect size\nTalkin' 'bout love [X3]\nGroovin' on the freeway, gauge is on the red\nGun down on my gasoline, I believe I'm gonna crack a head.\nTalkin' 'bout love [X3]\nI can't stop talkin' about...\nCome to me for service every hundred miles\nBaby, let me check your points, fix your overdrive\nTalkin' 'bout love [X3]\nFully automatic, comes in any size\nMakes me wonder what I did, before we synchronized\nTalkin' 'bout love [X3]\nFeather-light suspension, Koni's  couldn't hold\nI'm so glad I took a look inside your showroom doors\nTalkin' 'bout love [X3]\nOh, I can't stop talkin' about love.\nthese lyrics are last corrected by Salvatore Cacia"
