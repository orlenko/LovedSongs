S"Houses Of The Holy lyrics\nLet me take you to the movies. Can I take you to the show\nLet me be yours ever truly. Can I make your garden grow\nFrom the houses of the holy, we can watch the white doves go\nFrom the door comes Satan's daughter, and it only goes to show. You know.\nThere's an angel on my shoulder, In my hand a sword of gold\nLet me wander in your garden. And the seeds of love I'll sow. You know.\nSo the world is spinning faster. Are you dizzy when you're stoned\nLet the music be your master. Will you heed the master's call\nOh... Satan and man.\nSaid there ain't no use in crying. Cause it will only, only drive you mad\nDoes it hurt to hear them lying? Was this the only world you had? Oh-oh\nSo let me take you, take you to the movie. Can I take you, baby, to the show.\nWhy don't you let me be yours ever truly. Can I make your garden grow\nYou know."
